This is a continuously expanding list where I will post YouTube content like essays and podcasts that I consider particularly instructive and well-presented. I will limit this list to one video per creator, as I'm planning to make a separate list dedicated to entire channels. I may also be tempted to put a few cat videos on here, but I will try my best to keep feline hijinks to a respectable minimum.
