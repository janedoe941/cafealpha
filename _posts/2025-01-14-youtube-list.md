This is a continuously expanding list where I will post YouTube videos that I consider particularly instructive and well-presented. I will focus primarily on original video essays, rather than unscripted videos or content that was uploaded second-hand. I may also be tempted to put a few cat videos on here, though I will try my best to keep feline hijinks to a respectable minimum.
