Today, legendary director David Lynch passed away aged 78. As I wrote in my <a href="https://janedoe941.github.io/cafealpha/blog/top-films/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of favorite films</a>, he's my runner-up for favorite filmmaker of all time, and *Twin Peaks* is one of the most personally impactful works of art I know. I feel compelled to write a personal tribute to Lynch, though I'll have to make a small detour first.

You see, a few months ago I had an insightful psychological experience. Like for most of us, the horror of the genocide in Gaza (see the reports by <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/12/19/israels-crime-extermination-acts-genocide-gaza" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Human Rights Watch</a>) was mediated to me almost in real-time through digital screens. For 15 months, we routinely witnessed footage of weeping parents, mutilated children, babies frozen to death, children crying and begging to follow their dead parents to heaven, and much more. On the other side, we also saw videos of IDF soldiers gleefully laughing as they blow up entire street blocks, raping Palestinian prisoners, posing with Palestinian women's underwear as they rummage through the remains of what used to be homes, chanting genocidal songs about conquering Gaza and how there were no "uninvolved" civilians, etc.

How is it possible to be bombarded with such unspeakably cruel and horrible footage and not break down and weep every day? Clearly, the human brain is capable of powerful psychological defense mechanisms to prevent us from being paralyzed by the horrors we witness. When confronted with truly difficult to watch news footage like weeping children in a war zone, I can practically feel how these psychological barriers kick into gear reflexively, catching me in the last moment just as I'm about to break into tears myself.

These barriers held steady for about 13 months, until, in November 2024, a friend of mine from Amnesty International shared in one of our group chats a picture that she took that day. It depicted an anonymous tribute someone left in a public space, with roses and a placard that said "In tiefer Trauer den Kindern Gazas" ("in deep grief to the children of Gaza"). I don't know what it is about this tribute specifically—maybe it was just the right moment—but somehow it managed to catch me completely off-guard and bypass all my defense mechanisms. After studying the picture for a while, I finally broke down in tears. It seemed as if all the tears I held back over the last 13 months suddenly came flooding out at once. I hadn't cried this much since my father passed away when I was a little child. My brain was assaulted with a frantic montage of all the unspeakable footage I had witnessed throughout the past few months, mutilated children and laughing soldiers alike. I couldn't believe that this was really happening in the world. That powerful people were enabling this, that regular people were defending this, and that I was completely powerless to do anything about it.

It was quite an eye-opening experience, as it really made me realize just how much I rely on my psychological defense mechanisms to function normally on a day-to-day basis. Even now, as I'm typing out this post and recalling everything that happened in Gaza over the last 15 months, I can practically feel these barriers in the back of my mind, holding back a torrent of horrors trying to break in. Is this how great actors cry on command? They just casually lift the veil that keeps the horror out of daily sight?

In any case, after this whole experience was over and I started reflecting on it, I was inevitably reminded of the films of David Lynch. His storytelling is known for its heavy exploration of the subliminal, the dreamlike, and the nightmarish. I know few other artists who can "lift the veil" of mundane existence as powerfully as David Lynch, exposing the horrors we like to keep out of daily consciousness. It is cathartic to watch his films and know that, no, I'm not the only one who is disturbed by the horrible things happening in the world.

However, if Lynch was only interested in reflecting back to us how horrible and dark everything is, his stories wouldn't be anywhere near as powerful. What really elevates his cinema is all the strange beauty, mystery, and humanity that co-exists alongside the darkness. Like Julee Cruise's performance of "Questions in a World of Blue" in *Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me*, still one of the most profoundly empathetic moments of filmmaking I can recall.

Without the films of David Lynch, I would have been less well-equipped to reflect on why I broke down when I saw that picture with the roses and the placard. Rest in peace to one of the greatest directors of all time. I'll leave below my favorite video tribute to Lynch. What a strange, beautiful soul. Hard not to bawl my eyes out at the ending.
