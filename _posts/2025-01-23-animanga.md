Japanese popular media like anime and manga can appear somewhat intimidating to outsiders, and rightfully so: the industry is extremely profit-driven and plagued with [horrible working conditions](https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/7/2/20677237/anime-industry-japan-artists-pay-labor-abuse-neon-genesis-evangelion-netflix) that chew through aspiring artists at alarming rates. Unsurprisingly, this results in a lot of lazy and questionable content (to put it mildly), made to fill the pockets of production committees first and foremost, with artistic merit a distant afterthought.

However, there are always those artists who manage to prevail against a toxic environment and create something extraordinary despite everything. Moreover, Japan of course has a very rich history in art and culture, a lot of which makes it into popular media in some form or another. Thus, if you care to dig deep enough, you'll find that anime and manga can offer plenty of brilliant, unique experiences that should have something in store for anyone interested in art and storytelling.

In any case, this list shall serve as a handy resource for anyone looking for a few personal recommendations from yours truly. I used to have a phase when I was really into Japanese media, and while I don't spend much time with it these days, there are some favorites that I will always hold dear to my heart! <3

## Manga Series

### Vinland Saga


![Vinland Saga](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/iyOg1PSacGAIa1aeilAl8pVrCnC.jpg)

**Author:** Makoto Yukimura\
**Released:** 2005 - present\
**Chapters:** 216 as of January 2025\
**Genres:** Historical, Drama, Coming of Age, Adventure, Action

*Far to the west... across the sea... there is a place... called Vinland. It is warm and fertile... far from slavery and the fires of war. No one can reach you there. What do you say...? Will you live there with us?*

**Why it's great:**

Although *Vinland Saga* starts out as a bloody violent Viking revenge tale, astute readers may pick up on early signs hinting that this story's ambitions lie far beyond gory spectacle. The first part is essentially a lengthy prologue that serves to set up a massive character arc undertaken by our protagonist Thorfinn, who we follow from early childhood well into adulthood. Without going into spoilers, all I will say is that, with *Vinland Saga*, author Makoto Yukimura has confidently cemented himself as one the medium's premier champions of humanist, pacifist, and abolitionist ideals. Thorfinn's path cuts deep and is filled with unimaginable pain and suffering, but Yukimura's exploration of the darkest aspects of humanity is conducted with sensitivity and care, and he urges us to face the future with the determination to make it a place worth living in.

**Does it have an anime adaptation?**

Yes, and it's very good, though only covering the first 100 chapters as of the latest season (released 2023). You can go with either the manga or the anime.

### Aqua / Aria

![Aria](https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper/523/214/338/aria-manga-wallpaper-preview.jpg)

**Author:** Kozue Amano\
**Released:** 2001-2008\
**Chapters:** 77\
**Genres:** Slice of Life, Iyashikei, Science Fiction, Magical Realism

**Synopsis:**

*Three aspiring gondoliers become friends in the dazzling city of Neo-Venezia, a replica of Venice built on a terraformed Mars that is completely covered in water.*

**Why it's great:**

*Aria* is a gentle, elegant slice of life masterpiece that never fails to imbue me with a radiant sense of warmth and joy. A few chapters of this can be a perfect way to close out an exhausting day, when you just want to slowly drift into a peaceful, optimistic world with kind (and occasionally mischievous) characters. The story has virtually zero drama or external conflict; it's all about atmosphere, character interactions, and the uniquely beautiful setting of Neo-Venezia and its labyrinthine network of mysterious waterways and dazzling Gothic architecture. In addition, author Kozue Amano draws upon a rich mix of real Venetian culture with occasional sci-fi and magical realist elements to keep her episodic storytelling fresh. The illustrations are gorgeous too, especially the stunning double-page spreads that made me continually re-discover this wonderful city with new eyes. Sadly, I'm doubtful about visiting the real Venice due to its massive overtourism problems, but I'm glad I can at least vicariously explore the City of Water through *Aria*!

**Caveats:**

Although *Aria* is a piece of utopian fiction that presents a stirring vision of a kinder future, this vision operates largely on a vibes basis alone. Unfortunately, Kozue Amano's political imagination is somewhat half-baked, and the world of Neo-Venezia features a few questionable aspects that go unexamined. Most notably, women are not allowed in any occupations that require rowing boats, other than as undines (tourist guides). This is only mentioned in passing in the first chapter, but it is indicative of a wider sense of political underdevelopment. There are still interesting political implications in the worldbuilding of Aria, for example, the rejection of a growth-oriented economy built around consumerist conveniences. Nonetheless, for a more nuanced and politically conscious example of utopian fiction, see Ursula K. Le Guin's anarchist science fiction novel *The Dispossessed* (1974).

**Does it have an anime adaptation?**

Yes, it has a fairly strong adaptation, but the manga is still superior. Early seasons of the anime look quite dated and only exist in SD quality (or upscaled HD), as they were produced during the industry's bumpy transition from analog to digital production. For the ultimate *Aria* experience, I recommend reading the manga while listening to the anime's [beautiful soundtrack](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kNtzT3sTyhQjIkF2_90QBHO1OsQcZj86U&si=oxgr0rLeEfon0Rkh), which is heavily inspired by the wonderful Brazilian music style *choro*.

### Monster

![Monster](https://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/monster-by-naoki-urasawa-volume-1-.jpg)

**Author:** Naoki Urasawa\
**Released:** 1994-2001\
**Chapters:** 162\
**Genres:** Psychological Thriller, Crime, Mystery

**Synopsis:**

*Dr. Kenzo Tenma is a brilliant and conscientious young neurosurgeon from Japan who works in West Germany before the fall of the wall. However, he is naive with respect to the cold realities of hospital politics, and soon gets confronted with difficult personal and moral dilemmas when directed by leadership to prioritize high-profile patients. Things turn for the worst when he realizes that one of his former patients has turned into a serial killer...*

**Why it's great:**

A masterclass in building and maintaining suspense, intrigue, and a chilling atmosphere. The ending to the main serial killer mystery may not satisfy everyone, but I would say this is a case where the journey comfortably outweighs the destination. The supporting cast and their individual stories add a lot of depth to the narrative, and Dr. Tenma is a protagonist who is hard not to root for.

**Does it have an anime adaptation?**

Yes. I only watched a few episodes, but it seems to be a very accurate, almost shot-for-shot adaptation. You can probably go with either option.

### One Piece

![One Piece](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/7/79/Chapter_598.png/)

**Author:** Eiichiro Oda\
**Released:** 1997-present\
**Chapters:** 1137 as of January 2025\
**Genres:** Adventure, Fantasy, Action, Comedy

**Synopsis:**

*Wealth, fame, power... Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates, attained everything this world had to offer. The words he uttered right before his death drove people to the seas: "My treasure? If you want it, you can have it! Find it! I left everything this world has to offer there!" And so men head to the Grand Line in pursuit of their dreams. The world has truly entered the Great Age of Pirates!*

**Why it's great:**

Eiichiro Oda's gargantuan *One Piece* is the world's best-selling comic series of all-time, with over half a billion volumes sold. Although massive commercial sensations rarely correlate with artistic merit, in this case, the success is well-deserved. A sprawling, shamelessly romantic pirate odyssey that not only dares to dream big but very much insists on it, *One Piece* brims with exotic worlds, infectious camaraderie, endless hijinks, a palpable libertarian ethos (no, not the bad kind), and hard-hitting emotional highs that elevate the series from mere entertainment to a surprisingly inspiring and purposeful statement about the value of found family and the collective struggle against authoritarian power structures.

**Caveats:**

Although the series can be very funny when its jokes land, overall it relies too heavily on slapstick humor for anyone over the age of twelve. More embarrassingly, some of the female character designs can get quite sleazy in rather gratuitous ways, which is a shame, because the actual female character writing is generally strong and miles ahead of most of *One Piece*'s peers in the adventure/battle sh≈çnen genre.

**Does it have an anime adaptation?**

Yes, and it's a bit of a mixed bag. The pacing is generally a lot worse compared to the manga, the sound design is in desperate need of an overhaul, and the female character designs can get particularly egregious for certain story arcs. However, the adaptation does have a few genuine highs that no fan should miss, in particular the triumphant Wano Kuni arc, which employed many of the industry's best animators and emerging directorial talents such as Megum Ishitani to deliver some downright historic episodes.

## Anime Series

This blog post only covers anime series. On my letterboxd you can find a list of my [Top 50 Anime Films](https://letterboxd.com/grimoireweiss/list/top-50-anime-films/).

### Haibane Renmei

![Haibane Renmei](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/sC7DcOOWmQ2WNEVDjLY0t8rEwqS.jpg)

**Authors:** Yoshitoshi ABe\
**Studio:** Radix\
**Released:** 2002\
**Episodes:** 13\
**Genres:** Low Fantasy, Psychological Drama, Slice of Life, Iyashikei

**Synopsis:**

*Born into cocoons with cryptic dreams of their former lives as humans, a small commune of mysterious, angel-like beings pass their days in the outskirts of the serene and isolated town of Glie.*

**Why it's great:**

I probably think about this series at least once a week. The first half offers some wholesome and relaxing slice of life storytelling (a bit like *Aria* in a pastoral European setting), but the narrative eventually takes a more dramatic turn, diving deep into the psychology of its two central characters and exploring some very emotionally heavy themes along the way. By the end, *Haibane Renmei* emerges as one of the most graceful, mature, and profoundly empathetic works this medium has to offer. Among other things, it's about finding the strength to reach out to someone when you're at your lowest. It's also about saying farewell and letting go.

### The Rose of Versailles

![The Rose of Versailles](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/8aWflP87kbV0pnma3DLBUf6pfSF.jpg)

**Authors:** Riyoko Ikeda\
**Studio:** Tokyo Movie Shinsha\
**Released:** 1979-1980\
**Episodes:** 40\
**Genres:** Historical Drama

**Synopsis:**

*In the years leading up to the French Revolution, Oscar Fran√ßois de Jarjayes‚Äîthe last of five daughters to the Commander of the Royal Guards‚Äîis raised as a male successor to her father's duties at the Court of Versailles. Skilled with a blade and true at heart, the young commander quickly forms a personal bond with the Dauphine Marie Antoinette. However, Oscar's growing solidarity with the increasingly destitute common people of France gradually paints an irreconcilable crossroads looming ahead. What role will she play in that fateful year of 1789?*

**Why it's great:**

A radical and boundary-pushing sh≈çjo classic full of fire, pathos, and melodrama in the best way possible‚Äîby the end I was in tears more often than I cared to count. Oscar Fran√ßois is easily an all-time favorite protagonist and one of the preeminent genderfluid characters in anime and manga to boot. The story combines purely fictional elements (such as the protagonist) with an impressively researched dramatization of real historical events surrounding the Court of Versailles on the eve of the revolution. Unapologetic in its politics and history, Riyoko Ikeda's take on the downfall of the Ancien R√©gime presents an emancipatory perspective of class and gender that can be traced to contemporary communist and feminist movements of 1970s Japan. Ikeda's manga was adapted into animated form a few years later, with the second half of the series being directed by one of the pioneering titans of anime, Osamu Dezaki.

### Mushishi

![Mushishi](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/8ysRHGV3URjOJT7u7NkZiFjvObk.jpg)

**Authors:** Yuki Urushibara, Hiroshi Nagahama\
**Studio**: Artland\
**Released:** 2005-2015\
**Episodes:** 49\
**Genres:** Historical, Fantasy, Iyashikei

**Synopsis:**

*In an imaginary, pre-modern time set between the Edo and Meiji periods, a pensive healer and field researcher by the name of Ginko wanders the mythical forests and mountains of rural Japan to study primitive, ethereal life forms that afflict mysterious diseases.*

**Why it's great:**

*Mushishi* is truly one of a kind. I could try to pin it down to its brilliantly understated storytelling, its beautifully lush background art, its spellbinding, Japanese folk-infused New Age soundtrack that drips with mystique. But those descriptors still fall short of what makes this series so special. This may sound hyperbolic, but immersing yourself in the ethereal world of *Mushishi* feels more like deep meditation or a spiritual exercise than watching an anime. It's hard not to come away from this with a deep sense of humility, respect, and awe for the universe and the ecological interplay of all forms of life. Could you imagine a series with such a profound sense of tranquility being made for American television? Never. They'd rather make another dozen mediocre Simpsons knock-offs than realize that animation is capable of more than (ostensibly) adult sitcoms.

### Cowboy Bebop

![Cowboy Bebop](https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/A4PHx94G7mvM3b8vsDJ5HEaQ6uv.jpg)

**Authors:** Shinichiro Watanabe, Keiko Nobumoto\
**Studio**: Sunrise\
**Released:** 1997-1998\
**Episodes:** 26\
**Genres:** Space Western, Tech-Noir, Crime, Action, Drama, Comedy


**Synopsis:**

*Drifting across the colonized solar system of the future, the dysfunctional ragtag crew of bounty hunters aboard the Bebop pass their days caught between zany space adventures, existential ennui, and the nagging feeling that they won't be able to outrun their past lives forever.*

**Why it's great:**

Beyond its reputation as a particularly beginner-friendly anime due to its mature presentation and strong Western influence, Shinichiro Watanabe's legendary *Cowboy Bebop* has in fact been widely canonized as one of the greatest anime of all time. Is there any merit to these claims? If you're looking for hot takes, allow me to disappoint: it's not only that good, but even better. I've seen it (at least) three times already and it stubbornly refuses to be anything other than a brilliant anomaly in the anime landscape. This show's ability to make me cry one episode, laugh the next is utterly unparalleled. It also has one of the best television soundtracks of all time, thanks to the eclectic work of composer Yoko Kanno. However, beneath all the fiery jazz tunes, witty banter, and stylish action, there is actually a profound sense of melancholy underlying this series and its characters, so much so that they could have just as well named it *Cowboy Elegy*. This series hits deep (the ending is unforgettable), but it's by no means a misery fest. It's so full of life and creativity and all kinds of influences that one can hardly believe how they managed to tie everything together so beautifully and organically.

The opening is so iconic that I have to post it here. Just never gets old. *3, 2, 1, let's jam!*

## Glossary

**Anime:** In Japan, this term refers to animated works in general, regardless of origin. Outside of Japan, it typically refers to animated works specifically from Japan. Most anime series are adapted from other mediums such as manga and light novels, though original anime are also not uncommon, especially as feature films.

**Iyashikei:** Literally meaning "healing-type", this term refers to a genre of slow-paced, low-stakes storytelling that aims to induce a soothing effect on the audience and emphasizes mood and setting over goal-oriented plotting. The Japanese aesthetic/philosophy of *mono no aware* (the pathos of things) is a commonly employed motif, emphasizing the melancholy beauty inherent in the ephemeral nature of life. Essential works include *Yokohama Kaidashi Kik≈ç* (which employs a post-apocalyptic sci-fi setting), *Aria* (set in a utopian replica of Venice), and *Mushishi* (historical fantasy), though the latter represents a bit of an edge case as far as iyashikei is concerned.

**Manga:** Japanese comics, typically in black and white. Chapters are released in periodical magazines that run multiple series in parallel; chapters from the same series are eventually collected in standalone volumes. Commercially successful manga may get a television adaptation as an anime series. Oftentimes, a manga may only get a partial adaptation, primarily to promote the source material.

**One-shot:** Short-form manga story that is released as a single, standalone volume.

**Sakuga:** A particularly impressive animation sequence that requires experienced animators to pull off. In contrast, most anime is produced with *limited animation* to save costs. Particularly outstanding sakuga animators can acquire cult followings online. The [Sakugabooru](https://sakugabooru.com/) database collects individual sakuga sequences and associated meta data.

**Sh≈çjo:** Literally meaning "girl", this term is used to refer to works whose target demographic consists of young teenage girls (compare with *josei*, which targets older girls and women). I recommend not putting too much weight into these consumer demographics; works such as *The Rose of Versailles* are as worthwhile as anything to adults of any gender.

**Sh≈çnen:** Literally meaning "boy", this term is used to refer to works whose target demographic consists of young teenage boys (compare with *seinen*, which targets older boys and men). Sometimes, the term is used as a short-hand for *battle sh≈çnen*, which is a genre of long-running action/adventure series typically featuring young protagonists and published in sh≈çnen magazines. However, many other genres are also serialized in sh≈çnen magazines, and sometimes the demographic and the genre are erroneously conflated.
