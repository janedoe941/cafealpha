A fluid list that is subject to change—there are at least 30 films or so that deserve to be in my top 10, but I'm afraid the laws of mathematics don't quite work out that way. 

In no particular order, except that Miyazaki takes the top spot.

## Princess Mononoke

**Hayao Miyazaki, 1997**

If there is one film I wish everyone saw at least once in their lives, it's *Princess Mononoke*. I may have a slightly stronger personal connection with Miyazaki's follow-up *Spirited Away* (my first Ghibli film and a formative experience as a kid), but in light of our war-torn world in the midsts of ecological collapse, *Mononoke* feels undeniably more urgent. Besides the sublime animation, storyboarding, music, and worldbuilding that is to be expected of a Miyazaki film, one thing that particularly stands out to me is Ashitaka, who may just be the *busiest* protagonist I know. It is *hard fucking work* trying to stop humans from senselessly killing each other, let alone destroying the very world we live in, and Miyazaki rightfully shows us that any useful philosophy of pacifism cannot be passive. Ashitaka is not a pacifist because he takes a generic anti-violence stance (a minimal moral bar that every decent human being should surpass), but because *he actively does everything in his power to prevent greater violence*. At tremendous risk to himself, his first instinct is always towards de-escalation and the prevention of bloodshed, but even so, he doesn't get to reach the end credits without picking a side.

## A Scene at the Sea

## (BONUS ENTRY) Twin Peaks: The Return

David Lynch, 2017

With apologies to David Lynch and [Cahiers du Cinéma](https://www.cahiersducinema.com/boutique/produit/top-10-2017/), but I cannot pretend that a limited series qualifies as a film. Nonetheless, it would keep me up at night not to have anything from Lynch on this list, as he has cemented himself as my runner-up GOAT next to Miyazaki. I suppose I could have gone with *Mulholland Drive* instead, but I consider *The Return* his magnum opus by far and one of the most personally impactful pieces of art I know, so... \*shrug\*
