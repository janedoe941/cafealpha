A fluid list that is subject to change—there are at least 30 films or so that deserve to be in my top 10, but I'm afraid the laws of mathematics don't quite work out that way. In no particular order, except that Miyazaki takes the top spot.

## Princess Mononoke

**Hayao Miyazaki, 1997**

With apologies to David Lynch and [Cahier du Cinéma](https://www.cahiersducinema.com/boutique/produit/top-10-2017/), but I cannot pretend that a limited series qualifies as a film. Nonetheless, it would keep me up at night not to have anything from Lynch on this list, as he has cemented itself as my runner-up GOAT next to Miyazaki. I suppose I could have gone with *Mulholland Drive* instead, but I consider *The Return* his magnum opus by far... \*shrug\*
