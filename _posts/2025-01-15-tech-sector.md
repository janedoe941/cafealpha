After finishing my PhD, a friend once asked me why I, as a scientific programmer looking for a new position, was avoiding most of the tech sector during my job search. I responded that I consider the tech sector to be "a parasitic cancer on the human soul and all life on Earth (with some exceptions)". I feel like I ought to elaborate.

Let's go point by point.

(Work in progress. There is *a lot* to say, so it'll take me a while to write this post.)

## Social media and the erosion of truth

It's not good when oligarchs own our social media platforms and control our channels of communication. It's not good when Elon Musk spreads hate, misinformation, conspiracy theories, shitposts, and Nazi historical revisionism to an audience of 200 million followers, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/14/23600358/elon-musk-tweets-algorithm-changes-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boosting his own posts</a> and banning his critics. It's not good when Zuckerberg decides that now, just before the incoming Trump administration, is the best time to get rid of fact-checking on Meta. And with only a few days left before the US Supreme Court will rule on a likely TikTok ban, a major competitor will have been eliminated, leaving Meta and X free to spread total havoc on public discourse. At this pace, it won't take long before the average American thinks climate change is a hoax invented by "Marxists" and that the holocaust didn't happen, and if it did, it was also perpetrated by "Marxists".

### Meta's complicity in genocides

Let's not forget that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_genocide#Facebook_content_management_controversy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook played a determining role in the Rohingya genocide</a> according to the UN. Similarly, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amnesty International</a> concludes: "Facebook owner Meta's dangerous algorithms and reckless pursuit of profit substantially contributed to the atrocities perpetrated by the Myanmar military against the Rohingya people in 2017". And for anyone who believes tech bros are champions of free speech, I suggest taking a look at the following report by Human Rights Watch: [Meta's Broken Promises: Systemic Censorship of Palestine Content on Instagram and Facebook](https://www.hrw.org/report/2023/12/21/metas-broken-promises/systemic-censorship-palestine-content-instagram-and). Zuckerberg is a spineless coward and his submission/appeasement to Trump will only turbo-charge the UN Human Rights Council assessment of Facebook: **"a useful instrument for those seeking to spread hate."**

## Spiking energy demands of AI boom

AI is currently undermining what little progress tech companies have made on their climate promises. See the below video by Mexie, a postdoc in human geography / political ecology.

## Generative AI

### A middle finger to artists

GenAI has some use cases but also so many problems. The internet is being littered with low-quality, deceptive, misleading bullshit, which is bad for everyone. But it is especially bad for artists, who have to compete with AI-generated garbage that was trained on data stolen from them.

Graphics programmer and tech artist Freya Holmér recently released a powerful video arguing why *Generative AI Is a Parasitic Cancer* (best skip to 38:04; the beginning is a bit drawn-out). Instead of focusing on energy and copyright issues, this video is more about the value of real art and human communication, and what is lost when we increasingly rely on AI to handle written/creative tasks for us.

    <figcaption style="margin-top: 10px; font-style: italic; color: #555;">As if to illustrate my point, right beneath the Freya Holmér video I got a scam ad with a deepfake image of Roger Federer. My YouTube feed is littered with this shit.</figcaption>

### A gift to scammers and propagandists

Cody Johnston makes a great point why AI "art" is so popular in certain right-wing circles:

> AI images are a powerful tool for propaganda and misinformation and it is no coincidence that there are just so many shitty AI pictures making Trump look muscular or heroic or cool or kind or good or correct. It is quite simply the official art style of fascism. It's perfect for fascists and liars, isn't it? It completely cuts out creatives and favors corporations instead, it trivializes and devalues art over the need for profit, and it changes the truth to whatever you want it to be. It has that grotesque, fake sheen texture; an illusion of some flawless, beautiful ideal, smoothed over and perfected in a way that makes you nauseous. Not to mention that, thanks to who is making these AI tools, it algorithmically erases minorities and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24066641/disability-ableism-ai-census-qalys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people with disabilities</a>. It's a perfect little Hitler machine.

## Cryptocurrencies and NFTs

<a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2022/05/why-this-computer-scientist-says-all-cryptocurrency-should-die-in-a-fire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Should die in a fire.</a> Technology that is wasting ungodly amounts of energy just to make it easier to scam people is not what I call progress. And in this economy, people are *desperate* to fall for the latest get-rich-quick scheme. As Dan Olson says in his feature-length, viral takedown of the crypto boom: "The entire subject sits at the intersection of two fields that are notoriously prone to hype-based obfuscation: computer tech and finance." Truly, the worst of both worlds.

## Transportation

### Electric vehicles

The amount of <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/press-office/press-releases/leading-scientists-set-out-resource-challenge-of-meeting-net-zer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resources</a> required to build/replace the world's projected fleet of 2 billion cars with electric cars will exacerbate an already existing crisis of material overextraction (Jason Hickel, *Less Is More*). What we need is to vastly reduce the number of cars (the ones remaining should be of course electric) and focus on public transit, walkability, biking infrastructure, and urban planning. Great YouTube channel on these issues: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NotJustBikes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Not Just Bikes</a>. Unfortunately, advocating for a reduction of cars is not profitable for the car industry, so Elon Musk wants to convince us that the solution to traffic is to build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACXaFyB_-8s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small tunnels exclusively for Tesla cars</a> or some shit, instead of having, say, a functioning subway system.

> The narratives around electric vehicles over the past couple of decades leave out important context: the vehicles only appear clean and green because environmental messaging narrowly focuses on tailpipe emissions, ignoring the harm that pervades the supply chain and the unsustainable nature of auto-oriented development.

### Self-driving cars

### Gadgetbahn

## App-based gig economy

## Data colonialism

## Platform capitalism, techno-feudalism

## Fake innovation

What's the difference between innovation and progress? Progress requires a reference frame against which it is measured: it's not enough for something to be new, it also needs to be better than what came before. However, there is no such high bar for something to be *innovative*: it suffices to be new, shiny, and supported by a marketing campaign full of the latest buzzwords. No wonder, then, that Silicon Valley talks less about progress and prefers to fetishize the idea of innovation instead, as the primary goal is to make money, not to improve people's lives. I have already discussed the evergreen innovation scam of the "gadgetbahn" above, but let's take a look at a few more cases of "innovative" bullshit that tech bros have kindly given us, shall we?

### "Smart" water bottles and other bullshit

### Zoom's proposed AI clones

### Obfuscation of public funding of real tech innovations

## Motherfucking endless content, motherfucking apps everywhere

### Netflix' impact on cinema

### Dating apps

## Inane obsession with colonizing Mars

## Predictive policing and autonomous weapons

# An alternative future is possible

## The Wiki Society

## Free and open-source software

### Blender

## Solar punk and social ecology
