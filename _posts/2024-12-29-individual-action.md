A commonly heard argument takes the following form: "I think [X] is a good idea in principle, but my individual contribution to [X] is too small to be significant, so why bother?" Let's call this line of thinking the *appeal to futility*. I often hear this argument in relation to veganism—while many non-vegans might concede that avoiding animal products might be desirable in theory, they just don't think that their individual consumption choices have any meaningful impact in light of a globalized world. I would like to examine this argument in more detail, as it contains an important truth while also being quite flawed when taken at face value.

## Examining the appeal to futility

Let's look at another example: I frequently observe the appeal to futility from Swiss right-wing politicians who advocate against meaningful climate policy. They will note that Switzerland constitutes only ~0.1% of the global population; therefore, we shouldn't try too hard to combat climate change. China and India have over 1 billion people each: let them solve it.

Ok, let's examine this argument based on its logical merit (and generously ignore the fact the Swiss finance sector is responsible for [18-times](https://www.mckinsey.com/ch/our-insights/klimastandort-schweiz) our domestic GHG emissions).

If Switzerland's 8.8 million people are too meager to be counted in the global climate balance, and since our biosphere doesn't care about political borders, then any geographical subdivision of similar population size can also evoke the appeal to futility. The 8.7 million residents of Nanning, China, can also argue that they constitute only ~0.1% of the global population; therefore, their contribution to climate change is insignificant. It is always possible to subdivide people into sufficiently small populations, each of which can rely on the same maths to evoke the appeal to futility. In sum, however, this means that nothing will be done about climate change anywhere.

Similarly, if ~9 million people are at best a rounding error on a global scale, then, surely, any individual action is worth 9 million times less than nothing. Therefore, nobody has to do anything anymore. Nobody should bother recycling anything or think about their consumption choices whatsoever. We all get to drive SUVs since there is always a bigger polluter to point fingers at (like the guy with the private jet, who will point at the guy with the megayacht, who will point at the People's Republic of China).

By the same logic, there's no point in participating in our beloved Swiss direct democracy either, since, with several million voters, my individual vote has a weight of less than 0.0001%. Right?

## Why individual action is necessary

In the examples given above, the appeal to futility is a fallacious argument because it leads to the absurd conclusion that nobody has to do anything anymore. Of course, certain actions can indeed be futile: no matter how hard I push against Mt. Everest, I will not be able to move it. Even if I had the help of all 8 billion people alive today, the outcome would be the same. In this case, the appeal to futility is valid.

The crux is this: **If the sum of individual actions achieves the desired outcome, then the appeal to futility is a fallacious argument.** The individual contribution may be insufficient, but it is nonetheless necessary to achieve the desired outcome in summation.

Circling back to veganism: I am under no illusion that my individual consumption choices are going to save the planet. Nonetheless, it bears mentioning that a comprehensive study in *Science* shows that avoiding dairy and meat is the [most impactful choice](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth) consumers can make for the planet, that a plant-based diet could [save 75% of agricultural land](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets), and that the latest [IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/chapter/chapter-5/) urges a significant increase in plant-based foods and reduction in animal-sourced foods. Once study cited by the report concludes that the global average diet should be flexitarian to have a sustainable food system and a 66% chance of limiting warming to less than 2°C.

So, according to the available evidence, largely plant-based diets are a necessary component of a sustainable future. To achieve a world-average flexitarian diet, either everyone adopts a flexitarian diet, or we need an appropriate number of vegetarians and vegans to counter-balance those who substantially consume above the necessary average (like the meat-heavy Western pattern diet). Note that the flexitarian average is the bare minimum we need to achieve; there are many other reasons why I think striving for a fully vegan world is preferable, although this goes beyond the scope of this post.

## Why individual action is insufficient

When right-wing politicians evoke the appeal to futility to attack meaningful climate policy, I'd wager that most of them are well aware that they're just making excuses to desperately cling to a dying economic model addicted to fossil fuels. However, there is another critique of individual action that is not so self-serving and actually contains a valid truth: systemic problems require systemic solutions. We will not be able to buy our way out of ecological breakdown in the grocery store. Famously, the "carbon footprint" was popularized by British Petroleum, with the goal of shifting responsibility away from corporations and towards individual consumers.

In this sense, we must indeed be cautious not to over-emphasize individual action at the expense of movement-building and holding corporations and governments accountable for [their actions](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change) and [manipulations](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/). This is why it is important not to conceive of veganism as merely a diet, a lifestyle, or a consumption choice, but as political and social movement for environmental integrity, animal liberation, and public health (re: antibacterial resistance, zoonotic diseases, carcinogenicity of processed meat, etc.). Advocacy for the movement is part of veganism. The point is to transcend being a mere consumer and become a participant in an active democracy.

This is also why I don't adopt a moralizing stance against individual consumers. I am not shaming individual meat eaters for not being vegan. My goal is to present alternative perspectives and let people decide for themselves how to act. I know full well that I also engage in certain consumption choices that are detrimental to the environment and rely on labour exploitation in the Global South. It is almost unavoidable in our current economic system. However, the goal is not to become an ascetic or a saint. Any step in the right direction is already valuable; what form this step might look like can be different for different people, including flexitarian and vegetarian diets, other forms of activism, etc. And once you have taken that first step, who's to say you cannot take another one? In my case, about a year after adopting veganism, I started volunteering for Amnesty International, through which I have met many of the most amazing, kind, and committed people I know.

As for veganism as a movement: the good news is that we don't need to convince everyone. When a movement or initiative reaches a certain threshold of supporters, it can reach a social tipping point where it is accepted as natural by the mainstream, automatically drawing in more support. (This threshold is about 10 to 15% for initiatives that aim to revive participatory civic culture in local communities; see George Monbiot, *Out of the Wreckage*).

Democracy is not just about individually filling out a ballot once every election cycle and then disengaging from politics for the rest of the time. Democracy means continuous engagement, deliberation, debate, education, activism, organizing, protest and even civil disobedience if necessary. Freedom is a constant struggle!

**Change happens when people get together to make things happen. Individual action is a necessary but insuficient part of the solution, so it must be embedded in a larger social movement with collective action as a goal.**
