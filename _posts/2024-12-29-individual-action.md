A friend of mine who is a medical doctor once brought up multidrug-resistant tuberculosis while chatting about work. As a vegan, I had to point out that animal farming is a known [driver of antibacterial resistance](https://ourworldindata.org/antibiotics) (besides a whole slew of other, uh, "unpleasant externalities"). My friend agreed, but remained skeptical that individually adopting veganism could change anything. Aren't there much bigger polluters out there? I would like to elaborate a bit on this sentiment, as it captures an important truth while also being rather flawed when taken at face value.

A commonly heard argument takes the following form: "I think [X] is a good idea in principle, but my individual contribution to [X] is too small to be significant, so why bother?" Let's call this line of thinking the **appeal to futility**.

For example, Swiss right-wing politicians love to make the argument that Switzerland constitutes only ~0.1% of the global population; therefore, we shouldn't try too hard to combat climate change. China and India have over 1 billion people each: let them solve it.

Ok, let's examine this argument based on its logical merit (and generously ignore the fact the Swiss finance sector is responsible for [18-times](https://www.mckinsey.com/ch/our-insights/klimastandort-schweiz) our domestic GHG emissions).

If Switzerland's 8.8 million people are too meager to be counted in the global climate balance, and since our biosphere doesn't care about political borders, then any geographical subdivision of similar population size can also evoke the appeal to futility. The 8.7 million residents of Nanning, China, can argue that they constitute only ~0.1% of the global population; therefore, their contribution to climate change is insignificant. Moreover, if ~9 million people are insignificant on a global scale, then, surely, any individual action is worth 9 million times less than nothing. Therefore, nobody has to do anything anymore. Nobody should bother recycling anything or think about their consumption choices whatsoever. We all get to drive SUVs since there is always a bigger polluter to point fingers at (like the guy with the private jet, who will point at the guy with the megayacht, who will point at the People's Republic of China).

By the same logic, there's no point in participating in our beloved Swiss direct democracy either, since, with several million voters, my individual vote has a weight of less than 0.0001%. Right?

Wrong! Democracy is not just about individually filling out a ballot once every election cycle and then disengaging from politics for the rest of the time. Democracy means continuous engagement, deliberation, debate, education, activism, organizing, protest and even civil disobedience if necessary. Freedom is a constant struggle!

Circling back to veganism: I am under no illusion that my individual consumption choices are going to save the planet. Nonetheless, it bears mentioning that a comprehensive study in *Science* shows that avoiding dairy and meat is the [most impactful choice](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth) consumers can make for the planet, that a plant-based diet could [save 75% of agricultural land](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets), and that the latest [IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/chapter/chapter-5/) urges a significant increase in plant-based foods and reduction in animal-sourced foods. More to the point, veganism isn't just a diet, a lifestyle, or a consumption choice: it's a political and social movement for environmental integrity, animal liberation, and public health (re: antibacterial resistance, zoonotic diseases, carcinogenicity of processed meat, etc.). Advocacy for the movement is part of veganism. The point is to transcend being a mere consumer and become a participant in an active democracy.

However, having said all that, I do agree with what what my friend said in an important way.

When right-wing politicians evoke the appeal to futility to attack meaningful climate policy, I'd wager that most of them are well aware that they're just making excuses to desperately cling to a dying economic model addicted to fossil fuels. Needless to say, this was not my friend's intention. Rather, she actually touched on an important truth: systemic problems require systemic solutions. We will not be able to buy our way out of ecological breakdown in the grocery store. Famously, the "carbon footprint" was popularized by British Petroleum, with the likely goal of shifting responsibility away from corporations and towards individual consumers.

In this sense, we must indeed be cautious not to over-emphasize individual action at the expense of movement-building and holding corporations and governments accountable for [their actions](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change) and [manipulations](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/). This is also why I don't adopt a moralizing stance against individual consumers. I am not shaming individual meat eaters for not being vegan. My goal is to present alternative perspectives and let people decide for themselves how to act. I know full well that I also engage in certain consumption choices that are detrimental to the environment and rely on labour exploitation in the Global South. It is almost unavoidable in our current economic system. However, the goal is not to become an ascetic or a saint. Any step in the right direction is already valuable; what form this step might look like can be different for different people, including flexitarian and vegetarian diets, other forms of activism, etc. And once you have taken that first step, who's to say you cannot take another one? In my case, about a year after adopting veganism, I started volunteering for Amnesty International, through which I met many of the most amazing, kind, and committed people I know.

As for veganism as a movement: the good news is that we don't need to convince everyone. When a movement or initiative reaches a certain threshold of supporters, it can reach a social tipping point where it is accepted as natural by the mainstream, automatically drawing in more support. (This threshold is about 10 to 15% for initiatives that aim to revive participatory civic culture in local communities; see George Monbiot, *Out of the Wreckage*).

**Change happens when people get together to make things happen. Individual action is a necessary but insuficient part of the solution, so it must be embedded in a larger social movement with collective action as a goal.**
