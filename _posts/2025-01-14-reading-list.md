## ⭐ The Myth of American Idealism

**Noam Chomsky and Nathan J. Robinson, 2024**<br>
Tags: *history, politics, war*

![Book cover: The Myth of American Idealism]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cover-myth-american-idealism.png){: .align-left} Noam Chomsky is a 9000-year-old wizard and the leading critic of US foreign policy, with a body of work spanning countless books going back decades. The scale of his work makes it difficult for new readers to get a good overview of it all, which is why [Current Affairs](https://www.currentaffairs.org/) editor-in-chief Nathan J. Robinson decided to compile a single-volume summary of Chomsky's most important insights into the crimes of the US government.

What is the myth of American idealism? It's the official narrative that the US can, at worst, make "tragic mistakes" like the invasions of Vietnam and Iraq, but that its foreign policy is ultimately guided by a benevolent desire to spread freedom and human rights throughout the world. This may come as a shock to some, but Chomsky and Robinson show that this noble rhetoric does not match the historical record. Rather, US foreign policy more accurately resembles mafia logic, with corresponding punishment mechanics for those who defy the Godfather. Although to be clear, their argument is not that the US is uniquely evil, only that it is especially powerful, and as such its crimes more consequential.

## ❤️ Foundations of Economics

**Yanis Varoufakis, 1998**<br>

If economics as an academic discipline makes you think of complex mathematical equations and abstract graphs like supply and demand curves, you've been haunted by a spectre. The spectre of *neoclassical economics*—a narrow conception of economics that has, not without political and ideological reasons, come to dominate economic thinking during much of the 20th century. Fortunately, we have Varoufakis to dispel such doctrine for readers trying to get a more nuanced, comprehensive view of the field. Committed to honest, theoretical debate, *Foundations of Economics* is a brilliant, heterodox introduction to neoclassical economics and its history, providing an in-depth critique of the standard textbook material while also drawing a lot of inspiration and supplementary material from history, philosophy, and alternative theories such as Keynesian and Marxist economics.

Varoufakis doesn't tell you what to believe, only that no one theory has all the answers. As he writes: "Economics can no longer escape the political, philosophical debates which resonate across the humanities—from literature to sociology and from politics to moral philosophy. This is a good thing. At last, economics can become interesting again after a century of continuous pedantry." Although the maths is not very complex, it might still go a bit too far for casual readers, hence why I'm not filing this under *essential* reading. For a more accessible version, see [Talking to My Daughter About the Economy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36490332-talking-to-my-daughter-about-the-economy). Another favorite of mine is [Adults in the Room](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34673467-adults-in-the-room), Varoufakis' memoir on the Eurozone crisis.
