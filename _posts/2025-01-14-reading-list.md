![Book cover: The Myth of American Idealism]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cover-myth-american-idealism.png){: .align-left} Noam Chomsky is a 9000-year-old wizard and the leading critic of US foreign policy, with a body of work spanning countless books going back decades. The scale of his work makes it difficult for new readers to get a good overview of it all, which is why [Current Affairs](https://www.currentaffairs.org/) editor-in-chief Nathan J. Robinson decided to compile a single-volume summary of Chomsky's most important insights on the crimes of the US government.

What is the myth of American idealism? It's the official narrative that the US can, at worst, make "tragic mistakes" like the invasions of Vietnam or Iraq, but that its foreign policy is ultimately guided by a benevolent desire to spread freedom and human rights throughout the world. This may come as a shock to some, but Chomsky and Robinson show that this noble rhetoric does not match the historical record. Rather, US foreign policy more accurately resembles mafia logic, with corresponding punishment mechanics for those who defy the Godfather. Although to be clear, their argument is not that the US is uniquely evil, only that it is especially powerful, and as such its crimes more consequential.
