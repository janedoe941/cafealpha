## A foreword on terminology

I use the term "far-right" to label a spectrum that ranges from hardline right-wing populism to fascism. That said, I don't think the distance between the two is very large, with right-wing populism constituting a gateway to fascism if the opportunity presents itself.

## The far-right: similarities across the Atlantic

Despite some differences, I'd say the picture looks quite similar in the US and Europe, with significant cross-pollination between the various far-right movements currently gaining momentum. For example, ahead of the 2019 European parliamentary elections, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon was very busy touring Europe in an attempt to build an international right-wing populist movement (including a stop in [Zurich](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/politics_bannon-brings-his-populist-revolt-to-zurich/43950128)). Similarly, Elon Musk is now openly supporting [Germany's AfD](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/28/elon-musk-germany-afd-party) and intends to invest $100 million into [Reform UK](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/22/elon-musk-among-billionaires-set-to-donate-to-reform-uk-says-treasurer).

<!---
One striking difference is that, historically, the US is a country built and even defined by immigration, so it is especially ironic that American conservatives are trying to "save traditional American values" by running on an anti-immigration platform.

Of course, there is certainly also a degree of in-fighting among the far-right, like Le Pen distancing herself from AfD's Nazi historical revisionism. Regardless, these parties pay close attention to each other and rely on a very similar playbook, which I will try to summarize below, although I first need to lay some groundwork and talk about the N-word. No, not that one.

## The age of neoliberalism

(See addendum 1 for a note on the contentious term "neoliberalism")

If I were to trace the roots of our current political crisis, I would start with the dawn of (\*gulp\*) *neoliberalism* in the late 1970s, a political project preaching free-market solutions, austerity, privatization, and deregulation. However, as economist Kate Raworth notes, deregulation is better understood as *re*-regulation in favour of the superrich. With this re-regulation, the neoliberal era unleashed the banking sector (e.g. repeal of Glassâ€“Steagall act) and led to the increasingly toxic financialization of the economy based on speculative bubbles. There is an abundance of data that shows how inequality has massively intensified during the neoliberal era; one of the most striking figures to illustrate this shows the [widening gap between ever-increasing worker productivity and stagnating compensation](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/).

![Productivity-pay gap plot showing how, since the late 1970s, productivity has linearly increased, but hourly compensation has stagnated.](https://files.epi.org/charts/img/235212-28502.png)

This wealth differential was captured by the upper echelons of salaried professionals and capital owners, leading to massive inequalities and increasing resentment among working-class people. All of this was further turbo-charged by a multitude of crises and disruptive changes in the last 20 years, including the rise of the internet and platform capitalism/big tech, the economic crisis of 2008, the 2015 refugee crisis, and the fallout from the COVID pandemic. In times of crisis, neoliberal policies hit working-class people the hardest, but they present an opportunity for the ruling class to capture ever more wealth (a phenomenon called "disaster capitalism" by Naomi Klein). [As journalist Ken Klippenstein notes](https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/america-in-two-headlines), the following two headlines aptly illustrate the state of America in 2024:

![Two contrasting, recent headlines: US homelessness rose by 18% in latest annual data; the wealth of the world's five richest men more than doubled since 2020]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2020s-inequality.png)

To better understand wealth inequality and how it depresses wages, increases asset prices like housing, and reshapes politics and the economy in favour of the elite interest of the rich, I recommend the videos by British economist Gary Stevenson:

## The anti-establishment Zeitgeist

Given the consequences of neoliberalism just laid out, it is not surprising that an increasing number of ordinary people are developing a sense that they are getting the short end of a deal they never agreed to, and that something is fundamentally wrong with the status quo. This is why anti-establishment rhetoric is so politically expedient: Trump uses uninhibited rhetoric to sell himself as an anti-establishment force, although his actual political program is all about [consolidating the power of the oligarchy class](https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/the-consolidation-of-oligarchy). Similarly, the AfD's main appeal is that it presents itself as a break away from the establishment, which is especially resonant Germany's East, where people have been particularly left behind economically. Although a certain fraction of the AfD's voter base is certainly motivated by the party's far-right, xenophobic politics, there are also those voters who are less driven by ideology and more by a revenge-driven impulse to "stick it up to the establishment", without any illusions that the AfD's policy program is going to actually improve their material conditions.

Another politician who runs on an anti-establishment sentiment is of course Bernie Sanders. In my opinion, Sanders is much more genuine with his rhetoric and constructive with his program, although he is by no means as radical as the media portrays him. A common sentiment (e.g. shared by podcaster Lex Fridman in his interview with Sanders, which I only mention because a friend of mine likes this podcast) is that only Bernie Sanders could have defeated Trump in 2016. The Democratic establishment, on the other hand, has completely lost the plot with respect to the popular resentment against the status quo, leading to two defeats against Trump by Harris and Clinton (and Biden only winning because of Trump's catastrophic mismanagement of the pandemic).

Now here is the million dollar question: What stops regular people from uniting and confronting the billionaire oligarch class and the system that produces them?

Well, if I was a billionaire and wanted to sleep soundly without fear of the common rabble coming for my wealth, well, I'd have a few options. Common strategies include marketing myself as a "philanthropist" (see addendum 2) or fantasizing about retreating to a luxury doomsday fortress far away from the common rabble (addendum 3).

## The Far-right Playbook, Part 1: Divide and conquer

However, possibly the most successful option I'd have as a billionaire would be to simply employ the oldest trick in the book: distract regular people by making them fight amongst themselves. Maybe I'd donate $277 million to a demagogue who knows how to rile people up against "illegal aliens" or some other marginalized group, in exchange for billion dollar tax cuts and government subsidies for my tech companies. Or better yet, spend $44 billion to buy a social media platform to boost my inane posts fuelling moral panics about transgender people (such as my estranged daughter) and spreading the "great replacement" conspiracy theory to an audience of 200 million followers.

Far-right politics relies on regular people hating each other and being kept in a constant state of paranoia about "the Other". Transgender people have been one of the favourite punching bags of the far-right in recent years, but the biggest target is still painted on immigrants. From the US to Europe, the narrative is the same: criminal, lazy immigrants are coming to steal our jobs, traffick drugs, leech our welfare, destroy our culture, and replace white people.

### Debunking manufactured hysteria about immigration

If Trump's "they're eating the dogs" comment didn't make it obvious enough: this narrative about immigrants is based on complete lies. In the US, data shows that undocumented migrants have a [substantially lower crime rate](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/undocumented-immigrant-offending-rate-lower-us-born-citizen-rate) than US citizens and that the vast majority of [fentanyl trafficking](https://www.kff.org/quick-take/most-sentenced-for-trafficking-fentanyl-are-u-s-citizens/) comes from US citizens. Numerous studies show that immigrants as a whole either have [no effect on crime or even reduce crime](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/30/upshot/crime-immigration-myth.html). Moreover, undocumented migrants pay taxes ([$96.7 billion in 2022](https://itep.org/undocumented-immigrants-taxes-2024/)) while being [barred from federally funded public benefits](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/immigrants-public-benefits-us), thus effectively propping up the US welfare system (which itself mainly benefits middle and high-income households, see Matthew Desmond, *Poverty, by America*). Economists widely acknowledge immigration to benefit the economy (right-wing racists love to decry that immigrants are "stealing" jobs, ignoring that more working people also imply more demand for goods and services, thus creating new jobs). And the biggest lie of all: the "great replacement theory", a debunked, white nationalist [conspiracy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Replacement_conspiracy_theory) that relies on shoddy statistics and racist assumptions (and of course supported by the likes of Elon Musk, Tucker Carlson, [Vivek Ramaswamy](https://www.wired.com/story/vivek-ramaswamy-debate-great-replacement-theory-conspiracy/), Matt Gaetz, and other odious figures).

If I had to pick one political cartoon to summarize the far-right playbook, it would be the one below. Of course, being a cartoon, it misses some nuances (for one thing, the cookie pile in the middle should be literally a billion times bigger). However, to first approximation, this picture effectively captures the gist of how the far-right sentiment is fuelled by powerful interests.

![Cartoon: three men at a table: immigrant worker with empty plate, domestic worker with a single cookie, and a old guy in business suit with a pile of cookies, telling the domestic worker: "careful mate, that foreigner wants your cookie"]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cookie.png)

> "If you want to crush a revolutionary movement coming at you from below, nothing works quite like an anti-Semitic conspiracy that calls up hatreds older than Jesus Christ. In truth, any number of identity-based divisions can be marshaled to perform this function: Jews versus Blacks, Blacks versus Asians, Muslims versus Christians, "gender critical" feminists versus transgender people, migrants versus citizens. **This is the playbook used by Trump and the other pseudo-populist strongmen the world over: throw some minor economic concessions to the base (or at least claim to do so), unleash the dogs of race and gender-based hatreds, and preside over a rapid upward transfer of wealth, alongside an authoritarian concentration of power.** [...] In the Mirror World, conspiracy theories detract attention from the billionaires who fund the networks of misinformation and away from the economic policiesâ€”deregulation, privatization, austerityâ€”that have stratified wealth so cataclysmically in the neoliberal era. They rile up anger about the Davos elites, at Big Tech and Big Pharmaâ€”but the rage never seems to reach those targets. Instead it gets diverted into culture wars about anti-racist education, all-gender bathrooms, and Great Replacement panic directed at Black people, nonwhite immigrants, and Jews. Meanwhile, the billionaires who bankroll the whole charade are safe in the knowledge that the fury coursing through our culture isn't coming for them. Neither Steve Bannon nor Tucker Carlson invented this play. Over the centuries, anti-Jewish conspiracy has played a very specific purpose for elite power: it acts as a buffer, a shock absorber. Before popular rage could reach the kings, queens, tsars, and old landed money, the conspiracies absorbed it, directing anger to the middle managersâ€”to the court Jew, to the scheming Jew, possibly with horns hidden under his skullcap. To Shylock."\

## Addenda

### Addendum 1: Neither new nor liberal: on the notion of "neoliberalism"

### Addendum 2: The philanthropic illusion

If I were a billionaire and wanted to sleep soundly without fear of the common rabble taxing my wealth, one the options I'd have is to sanitize my public image by creating a "philanthropic" foundation named after myself. It is convenient strategy, since I derive significant tax benefits and still get to control how my wealth is used. French economist Thomas Piketty calls this the [philanthropic illusion](https://www.fastcompany.com/90474501/thomas-piketty-thinks-the-philanthropy-of-billionaires-can-help-pauperize-poor-countries). This is why leftists are critical of philanthropy as a means of solving systemic problems, as it is an undemocratic, top-down approach where the wealthy get to decide who deserves resources and how to use them. Philanthropy is thus contrasted with ["mutual aid"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid), a collaborative, community-driven approach of distributing resources to those in need. (Of course, on bigger scales, leftists advocate for more fundamental solutions to inequality, such as worker ownership of the means of production and the decommodification of essential goods and services.)

### Addendum 3: Fucking off to Mars

Another option I'd have as a billionaire would be to build myself a nice cozy luxury doomsday fortress while the rest of the planet fights bitter wars for the last remnants of fertile soil and fresh water. The ultra-rich tend to be less worried about the prospects of our planet heading for ecological collapse, as they believe to have sufficient resources to shield themselves from most of the consequences. For example, Peter Thiel, co-founder of surveillance company Palantir (developing not-at-all-dystopian technologies such as "predictive policing" and "autonomous weapons"), is very invested in the idea of building permanent residences out in the ocean, also called "seasteading". It's good to have a floating city for the ultra-wealthy so that CEOs can sleep soundly without having to worry about Luigi Mangione copycats. Of course, you can leave it to Elon Musk to spearhead the wackiest of all billionaire escape fantasies: colonizing Mars.
