## ‚≠ê <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205495275-the-myth-of-american-idealism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Myth of American Idealism</a>

**Noam Chomsky and Nathan J. Robinson, 2024**<br>
Tags: *history, politics, war*

![Book cover: The Myth of American Idealism]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cover-myth-american-idealism.png){: .align-left} Noam Chomsky is a 9000-year-old wizard and the leading critic of US foreign policy, with a body of work spanning countless books going back decades. The scale of his work makes it difficult for new readers to get a good overview of it all, which is why [Current Affairs](https://www.currentaffairs.org/) editor-in-chief Nathan J. Robinson decided to compile a single-volume summary of Chomsky's most important insights into the crimes of the US government.

What is the myth of American idealism? It's the official narrative that the US can, at worst, make "tragic mistakes" like the invasions of Vietnam and Iraq, but that its foreign policy is ultimately guided by a benevolent desire to spread freedom, democracy, and human rights throughout the world. This may come as a shock to some, but Chomsky and Robinson show that this noble rhetoric does not match the historical record. Rather, US foreign policy more accurately resembles mafia logic, with corresponding punishment mechanics for those who defy the Godfather. Although to be clear, their argument is not that the US is uniquely evil, only that it is especially powerful, and as such its crimes more consequential.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2018348.Foundations_of_Economics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foundations of Economics</a>

**Yanis Varoufakis, 1998**<br>
Tags: *economics, philosophy*

![Book cover: Foundations of Economics]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cover-foundations-economics.png){: .align-left} If economics as an academic discipline makes you think of complex mathematical equations and abstract graphs like supply and demand curves, you've been haunted by a spectre. The spectre of *neoclassical economics*‚Äîa narrow conception of economics that has, not without political and ideological reasons, come to dominate economic thinking during much of the 20th century. Fortunately, we have Varoufakis to dispel such doctrine for readers trying to get a more nuanced, comprehensive view of the field. Committed to honest, theoretical debate, *Foundations of Economics* is a brilliant, heterodox introduction to neoclassical economics and its history, providing an in-depth critique of the standard textbook material while also drawing a lot of inspiration and supplementary material from history, philosophy, and alternative theories such as Keynesian and Marxist economics.

Varoufakis doesn't tell you what to believe, only that no one theory has all the answers. As he writes: "Economics can no longer escape the political, philosophical debates which resonate across the humanities‚Äîfrom literature to sociology and from politics to moral philosophy. This is a good thing. At last, economics can become interesting again after a century of continuous pedantry." Although the maths is not very complex, it might still go a bit too far for casual readers, hence why I'm not filing this under *essential* reading. For a more accessible version, see [Talking to My Daughter About the Economy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36490332-talking-to-my-daughter-about-the-economy). Another favorite of mine is [Adults in the Room](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34673467-adults-in-the-room), Varoufakis' memoir on the Eurozone crisis.

## ‚≠ê <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138505710-doppelganger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World</a>

**Naomi Klein, 2023**<br>
Tags: *politics, sociology, memoir*

![Book cover: Doppelganger]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cover-doppelganger.png){: .align-left}

Brilliant memoir and insightful analysis of the resurgence of the far-right in the West. Of particular importance is the way far-right politics co-opts leftist talking points and twists them to serve reactionary ends. Sadly, this is not a new story: divide and conquer is the oldest trick in the capitalist's playbook, as is the symbiosis with far-right politics to keep regular people in a constant state of manufactured hysteria about "the Other". What is new, however, is the way that social media has completely turbo-charged the spread of misinformation and the powerful allure of conspiracy theories, making it easier than ever to divert working-class resentment towads the latest scapegoat *du jour*. For a snippet of the book, see also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxQ3EuEAOz0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ash Sarkar's interview with Naomi Klein </a> for Novara Media.

> "In the Mirror World, conspiracy theories detract attention from the billionaires who fund the networks of misinformation and away from the economic policies‚Äîderegulation, privatization, austerity‚Äîthat have stratified wealth so cataclysmically in the neoliberal era. They rile up anger about the Davos elites, at Big Tech and Big Pharma‚Äîbut the rage never seems to reach those targets. Instead it gets diverted into culture wars about anti-racist education, all-gender bathrooms, and Great Replacement panic directed at Black people, nonwhite immigrants, and Jews. Meanwhile, the billionaires who bankroll the whole charade are safe in the knowledge that the fury coursing through our culture isn‚Äôt coming for them."

## Extended recommendations

‚ù§Ô∏è <b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133922-educated" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Educated</a></b> (Tara Westover, 2018)\
Tags: *memoir, biography, family, education, feminism, religion*

Powerful memoir chronicling the author's upbringing in an abusive, conspiratorial, hardcore survivalist Mormon household that denied her education and healthcare, and how she eventually escaped this environment. Thank you to my friend L. for the recommendation!

üëç <b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/403846.Caliban_and_the_Witch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caliban and the Witch</a></b> (Silvia Federici, 2004)\
Tags: *history, feminism, Marxism*

I used to think that medieval witch hunts were the result of stupid peasant superstitions; this book makes the case that they resulted from a concerted political project to punish independent women and pressure them into an exclusively domestic, reproductive role during the early development of capitalism. Federici's chronicling ot peasant anti-feudal struggles makes this an instructive companion read to Jason Hickel's *Less Is More*.

‚≠ê <b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53328332-less-is-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Less Is More: How Degrowth Will Save the World</a></b> (Jason Hickel, 2020)\
Tags: *economics, history, sustainability, politics*

Shows how exponential growth and resource consumption is deeply tied to the extractive logic of capitalism, rendering it an unsustainable economic system on a finite planet. GDP is a woefully flawed measure for human (let alone ecological) flourishing, and we must come up with better ways of thinking what the purpose of an economy should be. Also challenges the rosy narrative that there was a linear evolution from backwards feudalism to freedom-loving capitalism, showing how the latter arose from violent enclosures of the commons and the ashes of crushed peasant rebellions who strived for a co-operative, egalitarian society.

Tags: *economics, sustainability, politics, business*

Rather than advocating for strict degrowth like Jason Hickel, Raworth advocates for a growth-agnostic economy that is distributive and regenerative by design. Crucially, the purpose of economic policy should be to balance the economy within the Goldilocks zone defined by two concentric circles: the inner circle represents the minimum level of economic development necessary to achieve universal human rights for everyone; the outer circle is defined by the maximum level of economic activity that can be sustained while keeping within the nine planetary boundaries established by Earth systems science.

Lays out how, contrary to the popular narrative of evil poor immigrant welfare queens, the US welfare state mainly benefits middle-class and high-income households at the expense of low-income households.

Tags: *veganism, food, health, science, politics*

A comprehensive overview making the case for veganism. Covers most of the important topics: ethics and animal welfare, environment and climate, nutrition and health, and countering the prevailing narrative. I also recommend the author's YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ed.winters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Earthling Ed</a>.

‚ö†Ô∏è <b><a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Art of Loving</a></b> (Erich Fromm, 1956)\
Tags: *philosophy, psychology*

An illuminating philosophical inquiry into the nature of love. However, the book is severely outdated in terms of its gender essentialist and heteronormative framing. Fromm's views on gender and homosexuality are likely a product of his time, but I cannot let the guy off the hook that easily: great thinkers, especially left-leaning ones like Fromm, should be expected to be able to peer beyond the tyranny of the status quo and identify areas where the emancipatory project has not yet been fulfilled. Nevertheless, although Fromm's blind spots are regrettable,  his basic thesis and delineation of love can be easily salvaged from these shortcomings.

> *"If I truly love one person I love all persons, I love the world, I love life. If I can say to somebody else, 'I love you,' I must be able to say, 'I love in you everybody, I love through you the world, I love in you also myself.'"*

üëç <b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/617702.In_the_Realm_of_Hungry_Ghosts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction</a></b> (Gabor Mat√©, 2007)\
Tags: *psychology, medicine, neuroscience*

Dr. Gabor Mat√© is a Canadian physician, addiction expert, Holocaust survivor, and advocate for Palestinian rights. Based on his work at a supervised drug injection site in Vancouver, this book offers a range of compassionate vignettes into the lives of his drug-addicted patients, digestible explainers into the neuroscience of addiction, a scathing critique of the failed war on drugs, and a powerful call for the decriminalization of addiction.
