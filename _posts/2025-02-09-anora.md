Damn, what an ending, huh? This was my second film by Sean Baker after 2017's *The Florida Project*—another excellent, humanistic study of existence at the margins of American society—and so far he hasn't missed when it comes to making endings that stick with you. However, whereas *The Florida Project*'s ending is told from the wishful perspective of a 6-year-old girl, *Anora*'s eponymous protagonist is a 23-year-old sex worker from Brooklyn who can no longer afford simple escape fantasies, and so the viewer is forced to confront the harsh reality of her situation alongside her. It's a powerful ending, and I'd like to mull over my thoughts a bit, so be warned that there will be full spoilers ahead.

As an aside: It is clear that the film is more interested in the dynamic between Ani and Igor than the one between Ani and Ivan. Ivan is a spoiled brat living without purpose because of his wealth and domineering parents. I said this before, but being rich really seems like a miserable existence that alienates you from ordinary human existence. That said, Ivan's lot in life would have been more deserving of sympathy if he hadn't reproduced his parents' cruel, self-centered attitudes towards Ani, so let's move on from this guy and finally talk about the ending.

Ever since the start of the second act, the film continuously foreshadows the final scene between Igor and Ani, and I was *almost* worried that the film would end with either: 1) these two characters getting together (the escapist happy ending), or 2) Igor raping Ani after being rejected (the cheap shock value ending). However, I trusted Sean Baker to be smarter than that, and indeed, the actual ending we got was far more interesting and complex.

The way I read it, the ending is built on a misunderstanding, specifically stemming from the transactional nature of human relations under late capitalism. When Igor offers Ani the ring, he isn't asking her for sex. I think he feels genuinely bad about what they did to her, and he is offering the ring as an awkward apology (he obviously also has a crush on her). Ani could just accept it and leave the car—it's her ring anyway. However, tragically, she has been conditioned to see every interaction from men as transactional, especially after the fresh wound from Ivan's betrayal. So, she accepts the "deal" and gets to work. Unfortunately, Igor lacks the integrity and empathy to decline her advancement. He thinks he won over her heart because of a few minor sympathetic gestures (which, to be fair, is more than what Ani is likely used to in her day-to-day life). Although Igor is clearly the most sympathetic male character in the film, he still takes advantage of Ani in a vulnerable moment, even if unwittingly. What else is there left for Ani to do but to finally break down in tears when the one guy who showed even minor consideration for her is too clueless to realize that sex in a shabby old car with a guy who forcibly held her against her will not too long ago is the last thing she would want at this moment?

In a different world, under different circumstances, Ani and Igor might have become friends, or more. But genuine human connection is difficult to reach when both parties are pitted against each other by narcissistic billionaires—Igor the gopnik henchman doing the dirty work for Russian oligarchs, and Ani the sex worker thrown away like trash when Ivan finished having his fun with her.

One of the many reasons why I take issue with unrestrained wealth inequality is exactly because it creates an underclass of people who are easily taken advantage of. People who are hustling and grinding and turning their bodies into commodities just to make ends meet. The promise of a quick way to the top is just too alluring when you’re down in the gutter. But even if you make it briefly to the top, you won't find what you're after there. The glitz and glamour is meaningless, the short-term gratification from consumerist opulence is meaningless. And once the inevitable crash comes, only tears remain, and scars. The oligarchs got what they wanted, and they threw some breadcrumbs at the peasant girl to shut her up. This is capitalism working exactly as intended.
