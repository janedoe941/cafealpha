What in the world is Trump doing? As Steve Bannon originally advised, he's "flooding the zone with shit". Beyond keeping us in a constant state of confusion and exhaustion from his rapid flurry of outrageous actions, his ultimate goals are the consolidation of power and the upwards transfer of wealth. But how far will he be able to go? Is American democracy over? A few perspectives.

## The Liberal Perspective

> *Cool down, he's exaggerating. His fast pace is a sign of desperation. Liberal institutions will hold. The judiciary will rein him in.*

## The Leftist Perspective

> *Looking at historical precedents of liberal institutions crumbling in the face of fascist takeovers, the parallels are bleak. We must stay vigilant and prepare for the worst.*

## The Dialectical Perspective

> *He has the strategy of being intentionally outrageous, of causing you either to not take seriously what he says, which is a mistake, or to take too seriously what he says, which is also a mistake.*

## The Wacky Theorist's Perspective

## The Small Business Owner's Perspective

> *Wait, why are my cheap immigrant workers getting deported?! I only voted for him so that the OTHER immigrants would get deported!*

## The Tech Billionaire Plutocrat's Perspective

> *Oh yes... Keep doing your thing, little orange man. We will have a nice spot for you in our techno-supremacist world order.*
